# OmniWeather

This is a simple Weather App built with TypeScript and bootstrapped with CRA :sun_behind_small_cloud:. It utilizes Unsplash's API for dynamics images, and OpenWeatherData for weather data, and Netlify's service for continuous integration. :sunflower:

## See the website live

The website is deployed at [https://omniweather.netlify.app/](https://omniweather.netlify.app/). :earth_africa: :sun_behind_rain_cloud:

## Getting started

To get going with the app, you run the following command in the root directory

`yarn install`

After that you're good to go, and can run

`yarn start`

to start the devlopment server. :tent:

## Tests

The app comes with Jest configured, but the test coverage is currently low. The idea is to complement the app with unit tests as well as some integration tests, to increase confidence when building it out. :microscope:

Tests can be run with
`yarn test`
